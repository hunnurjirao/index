        "description": "Sentiment analysis is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique used to determine whether data is positive,negative or neutral. For example: “I am so happy today, good morning toeveryone”, is a general positive text. Basically, Sentiment Analysis is the task of identifying whether the opinion expressed in a text is Positive or Negative. Natural language Processing (NLP) is a field of computer science, artificial intelligence, and linguistics concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages.",

        "description": "Chat-bots are computer programs that interact with users using natural languages. They use natural language processes for interaction. Chat-bot is a computer program which conducts a conversation via auditory or textual methods. Chat-bots are also used in dialog systems for various practical purposes including customer service or information acquisition. Some chat-bots use sophisticated natural language processing systems, but many simply scan for keywords within the input and pull a reply with the most matching keywords, or the most similar wording pattern, from a textual database. The chatbot is also known as chatter robots, are software agents that simulate human conversation via text or voice messages. One of the 1st and main goals of Chatbot had always been to resemble an intelligent human and make it hard for others to understand their real nature.",

        "description": "A Facial Recognition System is a technology that can capture a human face anywhere in an image or a video and also can find out its identity. A Face Recognition system has proven to be very beneficial in case of user identity verification in the recent past replacing the age-old authentication mechanisms like password protection or the One Time Passwords. In the last decade or so, we have seen a huge growth in the smart mobile industry for using face verification, and also numerous apps like Snapchat or Instagram which can put interesting filters on face. The ongoing research in this field has come up with a lot of scope in a wide range of applications, such as surveillance systems or law enforcement.",

        "description": "Image Captioning is the process of generating textual description of an image. It uses both Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision to generate the captions. Caption generation is a challenging artificial intelligence problem where a textual description must be generated for a given photograph. It requires both methods from computer vision to understand the content of the image and a language model from the field of natural language processing to turn the understanding of the image into words in the right order.

        "description": "Disease Prediction system is based on predictive modeling predicts the disease of the user on the basis of the symptoms that user provides as an input to the system. The system analyzes the symptoms provided by the user as input and gives the probability of the disease asian output Disease Prediction is done by implementing the NaiveiBayes Classifier. Naive Bayes Classifier calculates the probability of the disease. With big data growth in biomedical and health care communities, accurate analysis of medical data benefits early disease detection, patient care. By using linear regression and decision tree we are predicting diseases like Diabetes, Malaria, Jaundice, Dengue, and Tuberculosis. ",
